# Entropy-Controlled-Text-Generation-Balancing-Creativity-and-Coherence-in-LLMs
This project uses Shannon entropy to control text generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), balancing diversity (creativity) and coherence (logical flow). By dynamically adjusting entropy, we fine-tune the modelâ€™s output for applications like creative writing and AI content generation.
